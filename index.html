    <p id=intro>If you have come to this page, it’s probably because experience a hard time getting up in the morning. Perhaps you also fall into the habit of snoozing and want to stop, because you know that every time you wake up and snooze, you restart your sleep cycle, making it increasingly harder to wake up.
      <br><br>This page is here to help you with this problem through guided steps. And if you never return to this page again, we hope it’s because we accomplished what we set out to do- helping you to get out of bed in the morning!

      <p id="one">SUN</p>
    <p id="two">
      Our sleep and wake-cycle is regulated by the circadian rythm, an
      internal clock in our biology which is triggered by the appearence of
      light. The sunrise emulated on this page is thought to help you activate
      those cells and naturally wake you up.

    <p id="three">WATER</p>
    <p id="four">
      There is a correlation between dehydration and energy levels. Since you
      loose fluids during sleep, a way to combat drowzyness is to hydrate
      first thing in the morning.
    </p>
    <p id="five">
      Pro tip: Set yourself up for sucess by having a glass of water by your
      bedside the day before.

    <p id="six">OXYGEN</p>
    <p id="seven">
      When you breathe deep, fresh oxygen will help regulate the circulatory
      system of your body. Fueling your brain with oxygen can help increase a
      sense of alertness.

    <p id="eight">STRETCH</p>
    <p id="nine">Just like breathing, moving your body also helps your body’s circulatory
      system. Just a simple stretch first thing in the morning can aid you
      waking up.</p>
